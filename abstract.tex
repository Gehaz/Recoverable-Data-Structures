\begin{abstract}
Recent developments foreshadow the emergence of new systems,
in which byte-addressable \emph{non-volatile main memory} (\emph{NVRAM}),
combining the performance benefits of conventional main memory
with the durability of secondary storage, co-exists with
(or eventually even replaces) traditional volatile memory.
Consequently, there is increased interest in \emph{recoverable}
concurrent objects: objects that are made robust to crash-failures
by allowing their operations to recover from such failures.
This paper presents a principled approach to deriving recoverable versions
of several widely-used concurrent data structures, 
in particular, a linked list and an elimination stack.
